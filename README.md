TITLE: GA DSI07 Capstone Project: Telco Churn Analysis

SUMMARY: This is my final project at General Assembly (Singapore), as part of a 12-week Data Science Immersive course. 

**Motivation**
Being a business developer in my previous life, i understood first-hand the importance of being customer obsessed. Churn is immensely detrimental to a business regardless of one being an established MNC or a fledgling startup. 

**Project Workflow**
In this project, i sought to frame churn as a data science problem. Using a sample telco dataset from IBM Watsons, i broke the project down into 2 parts after some data exploration and cleaning using tools like Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. 

First, by applying binary classification techniques using models from Logistic Regression, Random Forest to XGBoost, i intend to predict customers who are likely to churn. Further, high precision-recall rates. 

Second, by using their profilescustomer segmentation  i built a recommender system to put forth marketing strategies that will optimize retention rates.
