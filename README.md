### TITLE: GA DSI07 Capstone Project: Telco Churn Analysis

This is my final project at General Assembly (Singapore), as part of a 12-week Data Science Immersive course. 

**Motivation**

Being a business developer in my previous life, i understood first-hand the importance of being customer obsessed. After all, they are the lifeline of any business. Churn is immensely detrimental to a business regardless of one being an established MNC or a fledgling startup, and it

Second, i would apply customer segmentation analysis and built a recommender system to put forth tailored marketing strategies that will companies to optimize retention rates.
